          HOW TO USE THE TEX BIBLIOGRAPHY DATABASES IN HATS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The instructions have been taken and derived from the MOBIUS bibli.bib file.


 0/ Please use only US-ASCII, 7-bit characters in editing this file.  Across
    the HATS project we have partners using different, incompatible, 8-bit
    encodings: any text that is not 7-bit clean will not survive the
    round-trip through everyones' text editors.

    Where accented characters are required in entries, use regular LaTeX
    commands like \"u or \t{oo}.  If these appea rin authors' names, enclose
    them in a further set of parentheses so that BibTeX recognises them as a
    single letter: e.g., M{\"u}ller.

 1/ All the bibliography entries of the HATS project are kept in the
    TexInputs/bibli.bib file. If you want to use the file just make a
    symbolic link to the file from your local latex directory (often
    ~/texmf/bibtex/bib).

 2/ Other bib files in the HATS svn directory may be deleted unless HATS
    has warned not to do so (there must be good reason to keep a local file).

 3/ Identify HATS funded publications using the "keywords" field.  This
    should contain the word HATS and the relevant workpackage:

       (at)InProceedings{
       ...
           keywords = {HATS, wp3}
       ...}

    This HATS keyword is most important: it differentiates HATS project
    publications from others, and is used to generate the publication lists
    in our annual submissions to the EC and on the HATS website.

    ENVISAGE MEMBERS, FURTHERMORE, PLEASE
    look up the Field Ranking (over "All years") of the publication venue in
    http://academic.research.microsoft.com/?SearchDomain=2&entitytype=2
    and record in the keywords-section as MSR-<value>.
      We need that for the KPIs! Yes, unfortunately the process of looking up a
    publication in that database is painful. Please explicitly use "MSR-0" if
    your event is not in the list or has a Field Rating below 20.

 4/ To avoid duplicate entries, each entry should use a standard key format:

    * the last name of the first author,
    * followed by the final initials of any co-authors,
    * the final two digit of the publication,
    * and finally "b", "c", ... to distinguish otherwise identical keys.

    Example:
        (at)InProceedings{AlbertAGP08c,
          author =    {E. Albert and P. Arenas and S. Genaim and G. Puebla},
          title =     {Dealing with Numeric Fields in Termination Analysis
                       of Java-like Languages},
          booktitle = {10th Workshop on Formal Techniques for Java-like
                       Programs},
          year =      2008,
          keywords =  {HATS, wp4}
        }

 5/ Enter author names in the form used by the authors themselves.  These do
    not need to follow any fixed format, as BibTeX will transform them
    according to the desired bibliography style.

 6/ There is a long list of (at)string abbreviations below for publishers,
    workshops, conferences and journals.  Please use them, and add new ones as
    required.  For papers at a conference or workshop, consider adding the
    proceedings volume separately and then referring to it through the
    crossref key.  There is already a list of conference proceedings at the
    end of this file.

 7/ If you find duplicate entries in the bibli.bib file, then in case of
           * identical keys: delete all duplicates
           * different keys: for the moment: inform the mailing list about
             the duplicate entry


 8/ Please keep entries sorted in the order of their keys, with
    crossreferenced proceedings (also sorted) at the end of the file.

  abstract =	 {We present the first static resource analysis of
                  timed concurrent object programs. Instead of
                  measuring the total resource consumption over a
                  complete execution, we measure the resource
                  consumption at different moments in time, that is,
                  the resource consumption over time.  To obtain such
                  a measure we perform a program transformation that
                  generates a program without time whose resource
                  consumption corresponds to the resource consumption
                  of the timed program during time t.  The transformed
                  program can then be analyzed with a combination of
                  existing tools. These provide upper bounds that
                  safely approximate the resource consumption of all
                  possible behaviors of the program at all possible
                  times.  We implemented a prototype of the approach
                  and evaluated it on a complex program to demonstrate
                  its feasibility.},
