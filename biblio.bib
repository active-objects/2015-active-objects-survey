@article{Elnozahy2002,
  Abstract =     {This survey covers rollback-recovery techniques that do not
                  require special language constructs. In the first part of the
                  survey we classify rollback-recovery protocols into
                  checkpoint-based and log-based. Checkpoint-based protocols
                  rely solely on checkpointing for system state
                  restoration. Checkpointing can be coordinated, uncoordinated,
                  or communication-induced. Log-based protocols combine
                  checkpointing with logging of nondeterministic events, encoded
                  in tuples called determinants. Depending on how determinants
                  are logged, log-based protocols can be pessimistic,
                  optimistic, or causal. Throughout the survey, we highlight the
                  research issues that are at the core of rollback-recovery and
                  present the solutions that currently address them. We also
                  compare the performance of different rollback-recovery
                  protocols with respect to a series of desirable properties and
                  discuss the issues that arise in the practical implementations
                  of these protocols.},
