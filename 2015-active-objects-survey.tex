use PA and ABS as a template to describe Encore -- Kiko? 

use PA and ABS as a template to describe Rebecca -- Marjan? 




\section{Introduction}

A global introduction to the common problems in programming distributed systems. Safety 
issues, common bugs and efficiency issues. A first overview of the families of 
programming models for concurrent and distributed systems. What is difficult? What 
features are important in concurrent? in distributed systems?

Definitions of the important notions like what is an actor or what is a future from a 
(old) historical point of view

\section{Active object Languages}

\subsection{An historical view of Actor and active-object languages}
Actors, Creol \cite{JOY06:creol}, JCobox, 

Plus a small (or bigger) note on : JAC, 
AmbientTalk, E programming language, Erlang, Kilim

Where do we put more modern languages like Akka?

	Requirements in the design of those languages


\subsection{Dimensions of Comparison between Languages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Target (what for?)  / Objective of the language
	\item Degree of synchronisation (from Rebecca to ProActive) from only asynchronus 
	interactions to strong synchronisation primitives (cooperative scheduling is probably 
	an intermediate feature here)
	\item Degree of transparency: how much is the user exposed to â€¦.
	\item How much data sharing? Under which condition? extremes are probably ABS and 
ProActive/Rebecca
	\item Formal support and  formal semantics
	\item \TODO{[Added by Justine and Ludo]} Implementation and programming and execution 
	support.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A Focus on Some Active-object Languages}
\subsubsection{Rebecca}
\subsubsection{ABS}
\subsubsection{ProActive/ASP}
\subsubsection{Encore}

\section{Implementation of active objects}
A comparison of Active object language implementations based on a set of comparison 
criteria including at least:

efficient implementation of the threading model (eg for cooperative scheduling)
comparie with: old java backend;
Encore explicit bytecode operations; haskell; new java backend; ProActive?
