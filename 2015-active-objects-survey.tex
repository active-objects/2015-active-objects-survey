\section{Introduction}

A global introduction to the common problems in programming distributed systems. Safety 
issues, common bugs and efficiency issues. A first overview of the families of 
programming models for concurrent and distributed systems. What is difficult? What 
features are important in concurrent? in distributed systems?

Definitions of the important notions like what is an actor or what is a future from a 
(old) historical point of view

\section{Active object Languages}

\subsection{An historical view of Actor and active-object languages}
Actors, Creol \cite{JOY06:creol}, JCobox, 

	Requirements in the design of those languages


Plus a small (or bigger) note on : JAC, 
AmbientTalk, E programming language, Erlang, 
Kilim, Scala actors, Akka, Go
\TODO{Not sure all of them should be cited but we will decide later}

Where do we put modern languages like Akka?



\subsection{Dimensions of Comparison between Languages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Target (what for?)  / Objective of the language
	\item Degree of synchronisation (from Rebecca to ProActive) from only asynchronus 
	interactions to strong synchronisation primitives (cooperative scheduling is probably 
	an intermediate feature here)
	\item Degree of transparency: how much is the user exposed to â€¦.
	\item How much data sharing? Under which condition? extremes are probably ABS and 
ProActive/Rebecca
	\item Formal support and  formal semantics
	\item \TODO{[Added by Justine and Ludo]} Implementation and programming and execution 
	support.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A Focus on Some Active-object Languages}
\subsubsection{Rebecca}
\subsubsection{ABS}
\subsubsection{ProActive/ASP}
ASP~\cite{ref:asp} is an active object programming language especially designed 
for programming distributed systems. In ASP, active objects coexist with objects 
that are not active. Only active objects are accessible between activities. The 
objects that are not active are only accessible within an activity; if those 
objects need to be exchanged between activities, they are copied. Based on this 
clear separation, the activity is the unit of distribution. ASP features mono-threaded 
request processing per activity: the execution of requests cannot interleave. 
The language is transparent: method calls are automatically turned into asynchronous 
requests if the targeted object is a remote active object. Similarly, futures are 
implicitly created upon asynchronous calls. Futures are also transparently manipulated: 
a wait-by-necessity is automatically triggered upon an access to an unresolved future. 
In ASP, futures are first-class: they can be passed between activities. In this case, 
when the future is resolved, the result is automatically updated at all locations.

ProActive is the implementation of ASP in the Java programming language, as a 
standard Java library. Basically, ProActive offers an API to create active objects, 
and a runtime for handling ASP features. The following is an example of ProActive program:
\lstset{
	emph={parameters,node}, 
	emphstyle=\itshape
} 
\begin{lstlisting}
T t = PAActiveObject.newActive(T.class, parameters, node);
V v = t.bar(); 	// implicit asynchronous method call
o.foo(v); 	// non-blocking operation
v.foobar(); 	// potential wait-by-necessity
\end{lstlisting}
%%% THE FOLLOWING MIGHT BE TOO DETAILLED %%%
% An active object is created using \code{newActive}, instead of the \code{new} of Java.
% The \code{newActive} primitive takes the class to instantiate, the parameters of the
% constructor, and the node on which the active object will be deployed.
% The variable \code{v} is the result of an asynchronous call; it is an
% implicit future.
% The dynamic type of \code{v} is a future that is a dynamically created subtype of \code{V}. 
% When the future value is needed to continue execution, such as in \code{v.foobar()}, 
% a wait-by necessity automatically occurs if the future is not resolved.
% In ProActive, when an active object is created, it is registered in the
% RMI registry delivered with Java. A local reference to this active object is also created: 
% a proxy that delegates invocations to the active object.
ProActive is intended for distribution; it is a middleware that supports application 
deployment on distributed infrastructures such as clusters, grids and clouds.
% The deployment specification of ProActive is based on the concept of virtual nodes: 
% a virtual node is an aggregation of physical machines that are declared in configuration 
% files (XML files). Such virtual nodes can be used in the code via their identifiers in order 
% to choose a specific machine on which to deploy an active object.

Recently, in order to adapt to the multi-core era, ASP was lately enhanced with local 
concurrency, namely, with multiactive objects~\cite{ref:mao}. The resulting programming 
language is called MultiASP. Besides taking advantage of multi-core architectures, 
multiactive objects avoid possible deadlocks in mono-threaded active objects. The principle 
of the multiactive object programming model is to execute multiple requests of an active 
object in parallel, while controlling the concurrency. The latest version of ProActive also 
implements multiactive objects. In ProActive, multiactive object features can be used through
a metalanguage, based on Java annotations, to allow a programmer to declare which requests 
of an active object can safely be executed in parallel. Such requests are called 
\emph{compatible} requests. The following is an example of multiactive object annotations 
in ProActive:
\lstset{
    morekeywords={@DefineGroups,@Compatible,@DefineRules,@Group,@MemberOf}
} 
\begin{lstlisting}
@Group(name="group1", selfCompatible=true)
@Group(name="group2", selfCompatible=false)
@Compatible({"group1", "group2"})
public class MyClass {
  ...
  @MemberOf("group1")   
  public ... method1(...) { ... }
  
  @MemberOf("group2")   
  public ... method2(...) { ... }
}
\end{lstlisting}
In this example, two groups of requests are defined, each of them holding one method. 
The two groups are declared to be compatible (so as their method, by extension). The 
\code{selfCompatible} parameter defines whether two different requests of the same group 
are allowed to run in parallel. At runtime, a ready request is automatically executed if 
it is compatible with requests that are already executing and with older requests in the 
queue (to avoid starvation). Programming with multiactive objects follows those principles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Without annotations, a multiactive object is a mono-threaded active object, without 
	any local parallelism nor race condition.
\item If some parallelism is desired, compatibility should be declared between requests 
	that can be safely interleaved and for which execution order do not matter. Compatible 
	requests should access disjoint memory locations to avoid race conditions. Possibly, 
	the expert programmer can also protect the access to some of the variables using a 
	lower-level synchronization mechanism and declare more methods as compatible. Generally, 
	compatibility is statically declared but can also be decided \emph{dynamically} depending 
	on invocation parameters or on the object's state.
\item If even more parallelism is required, an expert programmer can also protect the access 
	to some of the variables using a lower-level synchronization mechanism and declare more 
	methods as compatible.
\end{itemize}
Other high-level specifications are available in multiactive objects~\cite{henrio:hal-00916293}, 
such as request priority. To avoid thread explosion, it is also possible to set a limit on the 
number of threads running in parallel.  The limit can be applied in two ways: a hard limit 
restrains the overall number of threads whereas a soft limit only counts threads that are not 
in wait-by-necessity.  Additionally, threads can be limited per group.

As a conclusion, MultiASP and ProActive are based on the multiactive object programming model. 
This model is well adapted to non-expert because it provides high-level features for distribution 
and safe concurrency.
