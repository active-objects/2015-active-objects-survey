\subsection{Dimensions of Comparison between Languages}
Before presenting in details different active object languages, we would like to 
define in this section the key points we are interested in, regarding the design and the implementation of concurrent programming languages in general. 
Those dimensions of comparison, defined below, will then be used in the following of 
the paper to articulate our study.

\paragraph{Objective of the language} Identifying the objective of the language, for
which purpose it was created, is the first step to take for language comparison. 
Indeed, this underlying motivation for language creation will often explain the 
language design choices. For example, the performance of the language can be a crucial factor 
for which another aspect can be neglected, such as the accessibility of the language to non-
experts. Or, a high expressiveness can be expected for a language targeting several 
platforms. Having a precise context for a language often forces to define a trade-off between 
several objectives and for this reason, 
in the following each language description 
will start by a brief presentation of the language's objectives.

\paragraph{Degree of synchronisation} 
	The way a concurrent programming language is  designed highly 
	depends on the degree of synchronisation that can be expressed in it. Each language has a 
	different set of synchronisation primitives, although for active object languages, 
	there is a narrow set of such primitives. In some languages, inspired from pure actors, there is no synchronisation primitive: concurrent entities evolve in a completely 
	asynchronous manner and there is no particular instruction waiting for some event to happen. The 
	only synchronisation between processes is based on the fact that a message can only be 
	received and taken into account after it has been sent; nothing based on the ordering of the messages can be inferred. In this case, a forged synchronisation 
	can be obtained by choosing the set of messages an actor can handle at a given point 
	in time. On the other hand, many active object languages use futures as a synchronisation mechanism. 
	A future represents a
	result that has not been computed yet. When the result is computed, it can be 
	automatically available or explicitly retrieved, depending on the language design; we then say that the
	future is \emph{resolved}. A process can also block waiting for a future to be resolved.
	In active object languages, futures represent the result of asynchronous 
	invocations, and, in most of active object languages, an access to a future is a strong synchronisation point
	between concurrent entities. This strong synchronisation point makes 
	programming easier as it keeps a sequential workflow that the programmer can trust.
	Several active object languages also support cooperative scheduling: a thread can be 
	suspended (to handle another message) and resumed later. In such 
	languages, the suspension can be triggered when checking the state of a future, whether 
	it is resolved or not. This breaks the sequential processing of messages and requires a 
	better concurrent expertise from the programmer, but also allows him/her to write 	
	programs that are more efficient and less deadlock-prone.

	\paragraph{Degree of transparency} Another difference between languages 
	with concurrency constructs is the number and the complexity of the programming abstractions the programmer has to 
	know and master; among them some are explicitly visible in the program and some are 
	hidden from the programmer, in which say we say that they are transparent. For example,  some active object languages 
	feature transparent asynchronous method invocations, i.e. asynchronous method invocations that are 
	syntactically identical to synchronous ones. Some active object languages also feature transparent futures, which means that, on one hand
	variables which contain futures are not explicitly distinguished with a special static type, and on the other hand, that there is no 
	explicit instruction for accessing a future: an access to a future object is blocking 
	if the future is not resolved yet.
	In general, the more transparency of an active object language, the easier it is to write 	basic programs, 
	because the programmer do not need to know all the intricacies of the 
	programming model and because the parallelism can be provided automatically. However, when targeting 
	more complex applications, the benefits of transparency is weakened, as exposing 
	the programmer to all the programming abstractions that are used can make debugging 
	or optimization easier. 
	

	\paragraph{Degree of data sharing} Data sharing is a crucial aspect of concurrent and 
	distributed programming. Depending on the target application domain and the potential 
	for distributed execution, the constraints regarding data sharing can be very strong and 
	go against what would be natural in another context. 		
	Indeed, the most efficient way to communicate data between 
	different cores of the same machine is generally sharing, whether in a distributed 
	setting, copying the information to the different consumers of the data is often the most 
	efficient as it avoids peaking the data source, that can be physically far. 	
	Aside runtime efficiency, the complexity of the language implementation varies 	
	accordingly to the degree of data sharing it provides. For example, copying data raises the problem of 
	data consistency as data modifications may not be reflected on all copies.  
	But on the other hand, shared data access involves additional communication to the shared memory, which  
	involves additional synchronisation and delays. In practice, active object and actor languages that have distributed runtimes often use a ``no shared memory'' approach that favors 	
	data copies for objects in general, and that accepts a few entities that are globally known and shared. In other active object languages where all objects are shared, the advantage is that the manipulated programming model is simpler, but 
	the communication overhead is high, especially when programs are run in distributed 
	settings. 
	%Encore is probably the richest language from this point of view, aiming at a 
	%precise control of data sharing including entities that can explicitly be shared 
	%between different actors.

	\paragraph{Formal semantics and support} In order to reason on the 
	properties of a language, a formal semantics for this language is required. Most of the 
	active object languages have a well-defined formal semantics; this is probably due to the fact that the active object and actor models were designed to make concurrent entities run safer, so a formal semantics is needed to formally define their behaviour. Formal semantics 
	can then be used in several ways, either to prove generic properties on the language 
	and provide the programmer with guarantees, as well as to prove the correctness of some 
	implementation or some optimisations, or to implement formal tools for the analysis 
	of programs. A language that is defined with a formal semantics is likely to be more trustworthy, and we believe that having strong fundamental basis facilitate also the language expansion and thus its lasting quality; this is why we also take this point of comparison into account. 
	
	\paragraph{Implementation and tooling support} As a last point of consideration, we believe it is important to 
	compare the active object languages relatively to the related support tools they 
	provide. Indeed, the implementation of an active object language, whether as a 
	complete language or as an API in another language, is an additional factor to 
	take into account because it will determine also the inherited constraints that 
	apply to the underlying technologies that are used. Finally, the tooling support 
	around a programming language ranges from utilities to help the programmer 
	designing, writing, and 
	analysing their programs, to utilities to support the deployment and execution of these 
	programs. This point of comparison meets the previous one to ensure the sustainability of the programming language.

\subsection{A Focus on Some Active-object Languages}

\paragraph{General presentation and objective of the language} ABS (\emph{A}bstract
\emph{B}ehavioral \emph{S}pecification) \cite{JHSSS10} is an
object-oriented, concurrent modeling language developed since 2009 in
a series of EC-funded research
projects.\footnote{\url{www.hats-project.eu},
  \url{www.envisage-project.eu}} Its ancestors include \textsc{Creol}
\cite{Elinar2006} and \textsc{JCoBox} \cite{SchaeferP10b}.

In contrast to design-oriented or architectural languages, ABS code is
fully executable. There is a simulator as well as several code
generation backends (at the moment, for Java, Haskell, and Erlang. At
the same time, ABS abstracts away from features that make automatic
analysis difficult in mainstream programming languages. For example,
ABS has an object model, but it does not support code inheritance and
it enforces programming to interfaces as well as strong
encapsulation. It retains, however, modeling features that are
essential in realistic applications, for example, aliasing and
unbounded object creation.

The main design goal of ABS was to create a language that permits to
specify complex behavior of concurrent objects in a concise, natural
manner, while keeping automated analysis of that behavior feasible and
scalable. 

There are extensions of ABS to model product variability
\cite{HHJLSSW12} as well as time and other resources
\cite{johnsen15jlamp}, but these are considered to be out of scope of
the present article.

\paragraph{Language description} 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:layer} the language layers of ABS are
displayed. Based on parametric (first-order) abstract data types, a
simple, pure, first-order functional language with pattern matching
and strict evaluation is defined. On top of that are objects and a
standard imperative layer. So far, this is very much like
\textsc{Scala}-light.

The central issue for achieving automated, scalable analysis is the
design of the concurrency model. Formal analysis of multi-threaded
languages with interleaving semantics, for example, \textsc{Java},
while principally possible \cite{BlomHuisman14}, is highly complex and
seems to be out of scope at the moment for relaxed memory consistency
models. To achieve feasibility, the concurrency model of ABS carefully
restricts the possible interactions among concurrent tasks while still
allowing to describe complex, realistic behavior of asynchronous
systems.  
%
More precisely, the ABS concurrency model is based on cooperative
scheduling. This means that no task is preempted (interrupted) unless
its modeler explicitly allows to do that. There are two expressions in
ABS that explicitly release control: \lstinline{release} and
\lstinline{await}. The former is unconditional while the latter has a
Boolean argument and can be used to synchronize with another task.

We explain the concurrency model of ABS with help of the code in
Fig.~\ref{fig:abs-simple}. The unit of distribution in ABS is a
\emph{concurrent object group} (COG) which can be thought of as a set
of tasks that share a common heap and a single processor. Each task
executes code owned by an object and at most one task is active in a
given COG at any time. New tasks are created by asynchronous method
calls as well as, initially, by selecting the main block of a
module. An example of the latter is the code in
lines~\ref{abs:main:begin}--\ref{abs:main:end}.

Line~\ref{abs:main:begin} declares and creates a new object with
interface type \lstinline{Server} using the implementation in class
\lstinline{Service}.  The directive \lstinline{local} places the
object in the current COG. Without \lstinline{local} a new COG is
created together with the object. The next line declares and creates a
data object (note that interface \lstinline{Data} must be imported) in
the same COG. Hence, \lstinline{s} and \lstinline{d} share the same
heap. Line~\ref{abs:main:init} calls an initialization method
(implementation not shown) on the data. The notation ``\lstinline{!}''
signifies an asynchronous call. Its effect is to create a new task in
the COG of \lstinline{d} that executes the code of
\lstinline{init()}. Asynchronous calls do not interrupt the caller, so
the statement following the call is immediately executed. Therefore,
we need a handle by which to retrieve the result of an asynchronous
call once its result has been computed. In ABS the type of such
handles have a future annotation. As can be seen in
Line~\ref{abs:main:end}, it is possible to pass futures as
parameters. This makes it possible to use the result of an
asynchronous call in different places without copying it.

After execution of the main block finished, two tasks in the current
COG are waiting, corresponding to the calls to \lstinline{init()} and
\lstinline{process()}, respectively. None of them could have started
while the main block was still executing, because there was no
synchronization expression in the latter. ABS does not determine which
of \lstinline{init()} and \lstinline{process()} is started first. In
fact, ABS can be parameterized with different scheduling
strategies. The static analyzers of ABS take all possible scheduling
sequences into account.

A first synchronisation point is reached in
Line~\ref{abs:process:awaitd} of \lstinline{process()}. It ensures
that the value of the future \lstinline{fd} is available. If
\lstinline{init()} had not been scheduled before, it will be now. Once
the value of \lstinline{fd} is available, it is retrieved with a
\lstinline{get} expression. Note that \lstinline{rd} and \lstinline{d}
might well be aliased. The standard ABS idiom for asynchronous calls
in ABS is as follows:

\begin{center}
  \lstinline{Fut<T> fx = o!m(); ... ; await fx?; T x = fx.get;}
\end{center}

In many cases \lstinline{await} and \lstinline{get} follow an
asynchronous call directly. For this common sitation the abbreviation

\begin{center}
  \lstinline{T x = await o!m();}
\end{center}

is provided which avoids the declaration of an explicit future.

Line~\ref{abs:process:sync} contains a synchronous call which is also
possible in ABS. It results in sequential behavior, i.e., yields the
processor to the callee and blocks the caller until it
returns. Obviously, here we are interested only in the side effect
that \lstinline{modify()} has. Synchronous calls are only permitted in
the COG of the caller object.

\paragraph{Degree of synchronisation} 
If one attemps to retrieve a future value that is not yet ready, this
results in blockage of its COG until the value becomes
available. Obviously, this can easily lead to deadlocks. Many
deadlocks can be avoided by guarding \lstinline{get} expressions with
an \lstinline{await} (Line~\ref{abs:process:awaitd}). Clearly, not all
deadlocks can be prevented in this manner. In practice, however,
deadlocks are easy to avoid, because synchronisation points are
explicit. In addition, ABS comes with an automated deadlock analysis
tool for ABS \cite{CGM:SoSym2014} that detects all potential
deadlocks.  An important point is that between explicit
synchronisation points (\lstinline{release}, \lstinline{await}) no
data races can occur and computations are, therefore, deterministic.

\paragraph{Degree of transparency}

ABS is an abstract language and implementation-specific aspects
including scheduling, message queueing, object representation are
hidden from the modeler. Abstract data types and interfaces can be
used to postpone detailed design decisions while still permitting
analysis of those aspects of a model that are fully specified.

\paragraph{Degree of data sharing}

Between different COGs no data sharing is possible. The attempt to
call a method in a remote COG with a local class argument results in a
runtime error. Within the same COG all tasks have acess to a common
heap and can modify shared data. However, objects have strictly
private visibility, that is, they can only directly access their own
fields. The fields of any other objects must be accessed by explicit
method calls (getter/setter methods).

\paragraph{Formal semantics and support}

ABS has a fully formal, small step operational semantics
\cite{hats-d1.2} that permits formal soundness theorems for the
various analyses that are available for ABS. This semantics is
directly expressed in terms of rewrite rules in \textsc{Maude} format
\cite{ClavelDELMMT07} which yields a sound interpreter for ABS.

In addition there is an axiomatic semantics in the form of a program
logic~\cite{ref:key}. The behavior of interfaces and classes can be
specified by invariants over the histories of symbolic states as contracts 
between processes. 
Because preemption is excluded in ABS it is sufficient to establish
invariants upon object creations, at explicit synchronisation points and 
upon the termination of methods.  It is possible to prove a composition 
theorem for ABS about the relation between local and global invariants
\cite{Din14fac}. This makes it possible to prove global behavioral
properties of an ABS model by (method-)local reasoning.

\paragraph{Implementation and tooling support}

As ABS has been developed with the goal of being analysable, there is
a wide range of tools available. Most of them support the full ABS
language and are fully automatic. An overview of several of the tools
is available as \cite{BFH14,WongAMPSS12}.

There is an \textsc{Eclipse} plug-in that provides a development
environment for ABS and integrates most tools, see
\url{http://tools.hats-project.eu/eclipseplugin/installation.html}. An
alternative is the web-based ABS collaboratory at
\url{http://ei.abs-models.org:8082/clients/web/} which requires no
installation and also permits to try out most ABS tools.  Here is a
list of currently supported tools for ABS:

\begin{itemize}
\item editor with syntax highlighting and integrated build system,
  including compiler error location;
\item simulator/interpreter with interactive debugger;
\item visualization of ABS model execution as sequence diagram;
\item code generator backends for Erlang, Haskell, ProActive~\cite{rochas:hal-01065072}Java
  8~\cite{serbanescuNABN14a};

\subsubsection{ProActive and ASP}
\paragraph{General presentation and objective of the language}
ASP~\cite{ref:asp} is an active object programming language especially designed for
programming and deploying distributed systems. ProActive is a Java library implementing the semantics
of the ASP calculus. The language is designed taking the constraints of distributed
programming into account, and relies on Remote Method Invocation as the communication layer even though
other communication mechanisms can be used. ProActive is intended for distributed execution; it
is a middleware that supports application deployment on distributed infrastructures such
as clusters, grids and clouds. Several choices for the design of the language can be
explained by these practical concerns.

One of the design choices for ASP and ProActive is to ensure maximal transparency for the 
programmer: active objects and futures are manipulated like usual Java objects. The 
ProActive middleware automatically triggers asynchronous remote invocations and performs automatically blocking synchronisation when 
needed. ProActive is thus intended to Java programmers that are not particularly experts in concurrent and distributed programming. 

Since 2010, ASP features
\emph{multi-active objects}~\cite{HHI2013:mao} meaning that in each active object, several
threads can run in parallel and process several requests of this active object, but each thread is still isolated inside a single activity. 
Such multi-active objects feature at the same time local concurrency and global 
parallelism.

\paragraph{Language description}
In ASP, active objects coexist with objects that are not active; we call them 
\emph{passive} objects. An active object together with its 
service thread(s) its passive objects, and its request queue is called an activity. 
Each passive object is placed under the responsibility of an active object.
Only active objects are accessible between activities. The 
objects that are not active are only accessible within an activity; if those 
objects need to be used by several activities, they are copied in each activity. Based on this 
clear separation, the activity is the unit of distribution, which matches the usage of one memory space per activity. 
In ASP, when using multi-active objects, 
several threads can execute in the same activity, thus several threads can potentially access the objects of an activity. 

The language is transparent: method calls are automatically turned into asynchronous 
requests if the targeted object is a remote active object, otherwise it is a synchronous, local method call. Similarly, futures are 
implicitly created upon asynchronous calls. Futures are also transparently manipulated: 
a wait-by-necessity is automatically triggered upon an access to an unresolved future. 
In ASP, futures are first-class: they can be passed between activities. In this case, 
when the future is resolved, the result is automatically updated at all locations.

ProActive offers an API to create active objects, 
and a runtime for handling ASP features. The following is an example of ProActive program:
\lstset{
	emph={parameters,node}, 
	emphstyle=\itshape
} 
\begin{lstlisting}
O o = PAActiveObject.newActive(O.class, parameters, node);
T t = PAActiveObject.newActive(T.class, parameters, node);
V v = t.bar(); 	// implicit asynchronous method call
o.foo(v); 	// v can be passed without blocking
v.foobar(); 	// potential wait-by-necessity on v
\end{lstlisting}
%%% THE FOLLOWING MIGHT BE TOO DETAILLED %%%
 An active object is created using \code{newActive}, instead of the \code{new} of Java.
 The \code{newActive} primitive takes as parameters the class to instantiate, the parameters of the
 constructor, and the node on which the active object will be deployed.
 The variable \code{v} is the result of an asynchronous call; it is an
 implicit future.
% The dynamic type of \code{v} is a future that is a dynamically created subtype of 
%\code{V}. 
 When the future value is needed to continue execution, such as in \code{v.foobar()}, 
 a wait-by necessity automatically occurs if the future is not resolved. In ProActive,  
 proxies are used to handle transparently active objects and futures.
% In ProActive, when an active object is created, it is registered in the
% RMI registry delivered with Java. A local reference to this active object is also created: 
% a proxy that delegates invocations to the active object.

 The principle of the multi-active object programming model is to execute multiple
 requests of an active object in parallel, while controlling the concurrency. 
 In practice, the 
 programmer can declare which requests (i.e. which methods of the active object) can be 
 safely executed in parallel. Such requests are 
  called \emph{compatible} requests. The internal scheduler of an active object will allocate by default
 as many threads as necessary to run compatible requests in parallel.
  In 
 ProActive, multi-active object features
  can be used through a metalanguage, based on Java annotations. The 
 following is an
 example of multiactive object annotations in ProActive: 
 \lstset{morekeywords={@DefineGroups,@Compatible,@DefineRules,@Group,@MemberOf} }
\begin{lstlisting}
@Group(name="group1", selfCompatible=true)
@Group(name="group2", selfCompatible=false)
@Compatible({"group1", "group2"})
public class MyClass {
  ...
  @MemberOf("group1")   
  public ... method1(...) { ... }
  
  @MemberOf("group2")   
  public ... method2(...) { ... }
}
\end{lstlisting}
In this example, two groups of requests are defined, each of them holding one method. 
The two groups are declared to be compatible (so as their method, by extension). The 
\code{selfCompatible} parameter defines whether two different requests of the same group 
are allowed to run in parallel. At runtime, a ready request is automatically executed if 
it is compatible with requests that are already executing and with older requests in the 
queue (to avoid starvation). 

Without annotations, a multi-active object is a mono-threaded active object, 
without 
any local parallelism nor any possible race condition. Programming a mono-threaded active object-based application with ProActive is thus extremely simple. If some 
parallelism is desired, a compatibility should be declared between requests 
that can be safely interleaved and for which execution order do not matter.
To define a compatibility between two requests, the programmer can also use runtime information such as the request parameters or the object's 
state. Programming a multi-active object-based application with ProActive is thus a bit more difficult than programming mono-threaded ProActive active objects, but it is less complicated than programming with raw threads and low-level synchronization mechanisms while giving a competing parallelism compared to those ancient techniques.
However, if even more parallelism, out of the scope of request compatibility, is required, the programmer can still define more requests as compatible, and prevent unexpected behaviours with traditional low-level Java synchronisation 
primitives, this mixed approach goes beyond the traditional 
active-object model.

Other high-level specifications are available in multiactive
objects~\cite{henrio:hal-00916293}, such as request priority. To avoid thread explosion,
it is also possible to set a limit on the number of threads running in parallel.  The
limit can be applied in two ways: a hard limit restrains the overall number of threads
whereas a soft limit only counts threads that are not in wait-by-necessity. 
Additionally, threads can be limited per group.

As a conclusion, ASP and ProActive are based on the multiactive object programming
model.
This model is well adapted to non-expert because it provides high-level features for distribution 
and safe concurrency.

\paragraph{Degree of synchronisation}
In ASP, the only blocking synchronisation is the wait-by-necessity on a future. In this case, as requests run until completion, potential deadlocks can arise in 
case of reentrant calls, especially if no compatibility annotation is specified. 
However, synchronisation only occur when the future value is actually needed and, in 
particular, future references can safely be transmitted between activities without 
requiring any additional synchronisation, which limits blocking synchronisation leading to deadlocks.
Another form of synchronisation exists in the sense that, when a thread becomes in wait-by-necessity, it is not counted in the soft thread limit of the active object any more, so the wait-by-necessity event is potentially coordinated with the start of another request.

\paragraph{Degree of transparency}
In ASP the programmer is not explicitly exposed at all to the notion of future and in a moderate way to the notion of active object (at active object creation time only). The syntax is the same as the syntax for sequential 
programming, there is no specific construct for waiting a future value or performing an 
asynchronous call. Very often a sequential code can be reused unchanged in a distributed 
setting.

\paragraph{Degree of data sharing}
ASP follows a strict policy of absence of sharing between active objects. Objects that are 
not active objects and are passed by copy between activities (as request parameters or request 
results). Of course this mechanism applies also to objects that referenced by passed 
objects; a deep-copy mechanism is used ensuring that, when objects are transmitted 
between activities, they are copied as well as all their dependency on the destination 
side. This mechanism, which is the one used by RMI, slows down request invocation in practice because 
of the time spent to transmit data, but accelerates request treatment because there is no 
need to contact another activity to get the value of the request parameters.

There is no coherency ensured between the different copies of a passive object, thus if 
the user wants to ensure that an object has a unique coherent state, he should not 
transmit it by copy, and in this case transmitting an active-object reference instead would be the best choice.

\paragraph{Formal semantics and support}

Several papers formalise the semantics of ASP. The first of them formalised the 
mono-threaded part of the language and proved some determinacy 
properties~\cite{CHS:POPL04}. In particular, this paper proved that the order of future 
updates has no influence on the execution and that the only source of non-determinacy in 
mono-threaded ASP is when two activities can send a request to the same destination.
A functional fragment of the calculus has also been 
formalised in Isabelle/HOL~\cite{HKL:SCP11}. A specific semantics has been exhibited in 
order to evaluate a functional ASP program without risk of having a deadlock; the absence 
of deadlock has been proved in Isabelle/HOL.
The full semantics of imperative ASP with multi-threaded activities is published 
in~\cite{HHI2013:mao}.

As shown in~\cite{BHR2014:gcm}, ProActive active objects, and active objects in general,
provide a convenient programming model for component based composition of distributed
applications. The ProActive library implements the GCM distributed component model. In
this context, the Vercors
platform\footnote{\url{https://team.inria.fr/scale/software/vercors/}} provides
verification capacities for ProActive components; Vercors consists of an Eclipse plugin
for designing component systems; from this point the Vercors platform can on one hand
verify the correct behaviour of the application using the CADP model-checker, and on the
other hand generate an executable ProActive/GCM code corresponding to the designed system.

\paragraph{Implementation and tooling support}
ProActive is the Java library implementing ASP semantics. 
In ProActive, in order to transparently handle active objects and futures, a proxy is created for each of them. Proxies encapsulate all needed code to perform asynchronous, remote method invocations and wait-by-necessity behaviour. Whenever an active object or a future is given as parameter of a call to an active object,  it is in fact their proxy that is copied. This way, all copies of a proxy of an active object/future points to this same active object/future. 
Another particular aspect of ProActive deals with
the deployment of ASP active objects on distributed infrastructures. The design choices of the programming language typically target a high performance of distributed ProActive applications. 
In order to settle active objects on distributed infrastructures, ProActive features a deployment specification mechanism. The goal of this mechanism is to make the physical deployment independent from the the deployment logic. This is possible by having a binding from virtual node names, used in the source code, pointing to machine addresses or names. In practice, this binding is implemented in XML configuration files. Also, since the binding is made at \emph{deployment time}, changing infrastructure for a given ProActive application is only localised in a few files and does not require application recompilation. 
Several machines can be aggregated under a single virtual node name in the deployment logic, for example to provide the virtual node with some properties or non functional deployment options (such as fault tolerance or logging).


\subsubsection{Encore}

\paragraph{General presentation} Encore \cite{ref:encore}
is a general purpose parallel language based on active objects
developed since 2014 \NOTE{check year} by an
EC-funded research project\TODO{reference to Upscale}. 
The language has been designed to excel at scalability and rests on four pillar concepts: 
\textit{parallel by default} using the
active object paradigm for coarse grain parallelism, \textit{independent
local heaps} to promote data locality, \textit{type-based synchronisation directives}
provided by a novel capability system and \textit{coordination of parallel
computations and low-level data parallelism} via parallel combinators.
On top of these key ingredients, Encore stays loyal to the object-oriented paradigm
where inheritance is provided by a trait system and active objects and futures can 
be seen as normal Java objects.

\paragraph{Language description}
%overview (AO, thread control, heap, asynchronous; PO, synchronous)
In Encore, active objects have their own thread of control and communicate with each 
other by sending messages. These messages are placed in the receiver's message queue
and processed by the receiver one at a time. This property linearises
the execution of the active object which guarantees data race freedom. As in any other
object-oriented language, an active object has attributes and methods.
The active object state is usually model with passive objects. These do not have a thread of control and are
similar to \textit{unsynchronised} Java objects. A passive object lives in an active object's heap
and, if shared with multiple active objects, these could mutate the state in the passive object and produce data races.

Method calls on active objects are asynchronous and return a future value that, unlike ProActive,
has the explicit type \texttt{Future<T>}. A future value is a handle to a parallel computation,
has a well defined interface to operate on and is a first class citizen. On the other hand,
method calls to passive objects are synchronous and behave similar to Java objects.

The code from Figure~\ref{fig:encore:example} gives a taste of Encore:
\NOTE{the example could be better and show the use of futures}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left,xleftmargin=4ex,escapechar=\%]
passive class Data { ... }
passive class Queue { ... }

class Buffer
   queue: Queue
   
  def init(): void
    this.queue = new Queue()
    
  def put(item: Data): void
    this.queue.enqueue(item)
    
  def take(): Data {
    while this.queue.empty() {
      suspend;
    };
    this.queue.dequeue();
  }
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Buffer implementation using Encore\NOTE{Taken from Bertinoro paper}}
\label{fig:encore:example}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{Buffer} class (Figure~\ref{fig:encore:example}) represents an active object and
the \texttt{Data} and \texttt{Queue} classes are passive. By wrapping a \texttt{queue} object
in the \texttt{Buffer} class, the language guarantees that accesses to the \texttt{queue}
are serialised and, therefore data-race free.
