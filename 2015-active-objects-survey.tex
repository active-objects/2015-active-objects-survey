\paragraph{General presentation} ABS (\emph{A}bstract
\emph{B}ehavioral \emph{S}pecification) \cite{JHSSS10} is an
object-oriented, concurrent modeling language developed since 2009 in
a series of EC-funded research
projects.\footnote{\url{www.hats-project.eu},
  \url{www.envisage-project.eu}} Its ancestors include \textsc{Creol}
\cite{Elinar2006} and \textsc{JCoBox} \cite{SchaeferP10b}.

In contrast to design-oriented or architectural langauges, ABS code is
fully executable. There is a simulator as well as several code
generation backends (at the moment, for Java, Haskell, and Erlang). At
the same time, ABS abstracts away from features that make automatic
analysis difficult in mainstream programming languages. For example,
ABS has an object model, but it does not support code inheritance and
it enforces programming to interfaces as well as strong
encapsulation. It retains, however, modeling features that are
essential in realistic applications, for example, aliasing and
unbounded object creation.

The main design goal of ABS was to create a language that permits to
specify complex behavior of concurrent objects in a concise, natural
manner, while keeping automated analysis of that behavior feasible and
scalable. 

There are extensions of ABS to model product variability
\cite{HHJLSSW12} as well as time and other resources
\cite{johnsen15jlamp}, but these are considered to be out of scope of
the present article.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Language description} 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:layer} the language layers of ABS are
displayed. Based on parametric (first-order) abstract data types, a
simple, pure, first-order functional language with pattern matching
and strict evaluation is defined. On top of that are objects and a
standard imperative layer. So far, this is very much like
\textsc{Scala}-light.

The central issue for achieving automated, scalable analysis is the
design of the concurrency model. Formal analysis of multi-threaded
languages with interleaving semantics, for example, \textsc{Java},
while principally possible \cite{BlomHuisman14}, is highly complex and
seems to be out of scope at the moment for relaxed memory consistency
models. To achieve feasibility, the concurrency model of ABS carefully
restricts the possible interactions among concurrent tasks while still
allowing to describe complex, realistic behavior of asynchronous
systems.  
%
More precisely, the ABS concurrency model is based on cooperative
scheduling. This means that no task is preempted (interrupted) unless
its modeler explicitly allows to do that. There are two expressions in
ABS that explicitly release control: \lstinline{release} and
\lstinline{await}. The former is unconditional while the latter has a
Boolean argument and can be used to synchronize with another task.

We explain the concurrency model of ABS with help of the code in
Fig.~\ref{fig:abs-simple}. The unit of distribution in ABS is a
\emph{concurrent object group} (COG) which can be thought of as a set
of tasks that share a common heap and a single processor. Each task
executes code owned by an object and at most one task is active in a
given COG at any time. New tasks are created by asynchronous method
calls as well as, initially, by selecting the main block of a
module. An example of the latter is the code in
lines~\ref{abs:main:begin}--\ref{abs:main:end}.

Line~\ref{abs:main:begin} declares and creates a new object with
interface type \lstinline{Server} using the implementation in class
\lstinline{Service}.  The directive \lstinline{local} places the
object in the current COG. Without \lstinline{local} a new COG is
created together with the object. The next line declares and creates a
data object (note that interface \lstinline{Data} must be imported) in
the same COG. Hence, \lstinline{s} and \lstinline{d} share the same
heap. Line~\ref{abs:main:init} calls an initialization method
(implementation not shown) on the data. The notation ``\lstinline{!}''
signifies an asynchronous call. Its effect is to create a new task in
the COG of \lstinline{d} that executes the code of
\lstinline{init()}. Asynchronous calls do not interrupt the caller, so
the statement following the call is immediately executed. Therefore,
we need a handle by which to retrieve the result of an asynchronous
call once its result has been computed. In ABS the type of such
handles have a future annotation. As can be seen in
Line~\ref{abs:main:end}, it is possible to pass futures as
parameters. This makes it possible to use the result of an
asynchronous call in different places without copying it.

After execution of the main block finished, two tasks in the current
COG are waiting, corresponding to the calls to \lstinline{init()} and
\lstinline{process()}, respectively. None of them could have started
while the main block was still executing, because there was no
synchronization expression in the latter. ABS does not determine which
of \lstinline{init()} and \lstinline{process()} is started first. In
fact, ABS can be parameterized with different scheduling
strategies. The static analyzers of ABS take all possible scheduling
sequences into account.

A first synchronisation point is reached in
Line~\ref{abs:process:awaitd} of \lstinline{process()}. It ensures
that the value of the future \lstinline{fd} is available. If
\lstinline{init()} had not been scheduled before, it will be now. Once
the value of \lstinline{fd} is available, it is retrieved with a
\lstinline{get} expression. Note that \lstinline{rd} and \lstinline{d}
might well be aliases. The standard ABS idiom for asynchronous calls
in ABS is as follows:

\begin{center}
  \lstinline{Fut<T> fx = o!m(); ... ; await fx?; T x = fx.get;}
\end{center}

In many cases \lstinline{await} and \lstinline{get} follow an
asynchronous call directly. For this common sitation the abbreviation

\begin{center}
  \lstinline{T x = await o!m();}
\end{center}

is provided which avoids the declaration of an explicit future.

Line~\ref{abs:process:sync} contains a synchronous call which is also
possible in ABS. It results in sequential behavior, i.e., yields the
processor to the callee and blocks the caller until it
returns. Obviously, here we are interested only in the side effect
that \lstinline{modify()} has. Synchronous calls are only permitted in
the COG of the caller object.

\paragraph{Degree of synchronisation} 
If one attemps to retrieve a future value that is not yet ready, this
results in blockage of its COG until the value becomes
available. Obviously, this can easily lead to deadlocks. Many
deadlocks can be avoided by guarding \lstinline{get} expressions with
an \lstinline{await} (Line~\ref{abs:process:awaitd}). Clearly, not all
deadlocks can be prevented in this manner. In practice, however,
deadlocks are easy to avoid, because synchronisation points are
explicit. In addition, ABS comes with an automated deadlock analysis
tool for ABS \cite{CGM:SoSym2014} that detects all potential
deadlocks.  An important point is that between explicit
synchronisation points (\lstinline{release}, \lstinline{await}) no
data races can occur and computations are, therefore, deterministic.

\paragraph{Degree of transparency}

ABS is an abstract language and implementation-specific aspects
including scheduling, message queueing, object representation are
hidden from the modeler. Abstract data types and interfaces can be
used to postpone detailed design decisions while still permitting
analysis of those aspects of a model that are fully specified.

\paragraph{Data sharing}

Between different COGs no data sharing is possible. The attempt to
call a method in a remote COG with a local class argument results in a
runtime error. Within the same COG all tasks have acess to a common
heap and can modify shared data. However, objects have strictly
private visibility, that is, they can only directly access their own
fields. The fields of any other objects must be accessed by explicit
method calls (getter/setter methods).

\paragraph{Formalization and semantics}

ABS has a fully formal, small step operational semantics
\cite{hats-d1.2} that permits formal soundness theorems for the
various analyses that are available for ABS. This semantics is
directly expressed in terms of rewrite rules in \textsc{Maude} format
\cite{ClavelDELMMT07} which yields a sound interpreter for ABS.

In addition there is an axiomatic semantics in the form of a program
logic~\cite{ref:key}. The behavior of interfaces and classes can be
specified by invariants over the histories of symbolic states.
Because preemption is excluded in ABS it is sufficient to establish
invariants at explicit synchronisation points and upon the termination
of methods. It is possible to prove a composition theorem for ABS
about the relation between local and global invariants
\cite{Din14fac}. This makes it possible to prove global behavioral
properties of an ABS model by (method-)local reasoning.

\paragraph{Implementation and tool support}

As ABS has been developed with the goal of being analysable, there is
a wide range of tools available. Most of them support the full ABS
language and are fully automatic. An overview of several of the tools
is available as \cite{BFH14,WongAMPSS12}.

There is an \textsc{Eclipse} plug-in that provides a development
environment for ABS and integrates most tools, see
\url{http://tools.hats-project.eu/eclipseplugin/installation.html}. An
alternative is the web-based ABS collaboratory at
\url{http://ei.abs-models.org:8082/clients/web/} which requires no
installation and also permits to try out most ABS tools.  Here is a
list of currently supported tools for ABS:

\begin{itemize}
\item editor with syntax highlighting and integrated build system,
  including compiler error location;
\item simulator/interpreter with interactive debugger;
\item visualization of ABS model execution as sequence diagram;
\item code generator backends for Erlang, Haskell, Java
  8~\cite{serbanescuNABN14a};
\item a glass box test case generator for \emph{concurrent} models \cite{AlbertAGM15};
\item a sound deadlock analysis \cite{CGM:SoSym2014};
\item a worst-case resource analysis that can be parameterized with a
  cost model for execution time, memory consumption, transmission
  size, peak cost and various other cost categories \cite{AlbertAFGGMPR14};
\item a deductive verification tool for expressive, history-based
  property specifications \cite{ref:key}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{ProActive and ASP}
\paragraph{General presentation}\NOTE{including the main purpose of the language}
ASP~\cite{ref:asp} is an active object programming language especially designed for
programming distributed systems. ProActive is a Java library implementing the semantics
of the ASP calculus. The language is designed taking the constraints of distributed
programming into account, and relies on RMI as the communication layer even though
another communication mechanism can be used. ProActive is intended for distribution; it
is a middleware that supports application deployment on distributed infrastructures such
as clusters, grids and clouds.Several of the design-choices of the language can be
explained by these practical concerns.

A crucial design choice of ASP and ProActive is to ensure maximal transparency for the 
programmer: active objects and futures are manipulated like usual Java objects. The 
language automatically trigger asynchronous remote invocation or synchronisation when 
needed.

Since 2010 ASP features
\emph{multi-active objects}~\cite{ref:mao} meaning that in each active object, several
threads can run in parallel, but each thread is still isolated inside a single activity. 
Such Multi-active objects feature at the same time local concurrency and global 
parallelism.

\paragraph{Language description}\NOTE{semantics; do we include a formal semantics here?}
In ASP, active objects coexist with objects that are not active. However each object is 
placed under the responsibility of an active object. An active object together with its 
service thread(s) its passive objects, and its request queue is called an activity.
Only active objects are accessible between activities. The 
objects that are not active are only accessible within an activity; if those 
objects need to be exchanged between activities, they are copied. Based on this 
clear separation, the activity is the unit of distribution. 
In ASP each thread runs inside a single activity but in the case of multi-active objects 
several threads can execute in the same active objects. 

\TODO{Do we keep the MultiASP notation or simply call it ASP?}


The language is transparent: method calls are automatically turned into asynchronous 
requests if the targeted object is a remote active object. Similarly, futures are 
implicitly created upon asynchronous calls. Futures are also transparently manipulated: 
a wait-by-necessity is automatically triggered upon an access to an unresolved future. 
In ASP, futures are first-class: they can be passed between activities. In this case, 
when the future is resolved, the result is automatically updated at all locations.

ProActive offers an API to create active objects, 
and a runtime for handling ASP features. The following is an example of ProActive program:
\lstset{
	emph={parameters,node}, 
	emphstyle=\itshape
} 
\begin{lstlisting}
T t = PAActiveObject.newActive(T.class, parameters, node);
V v = t.bar(); 	// implicit asynchronous method call
o.foo(v); 	// non-blocking operation
v.foobar(); 	// potential wait-by-necessity
\end{lstlisting}
%%% THE FOLLOWING MIGHT BE TOO DETAILLED %%%
 An active object is created using \code{newActive}, instead of the \code{new} of Java.
 The \code{newActive} primitive takes the class to instantiate, the parameters of the
 constructor, and the node on which the active object will be deployed.
 The variable \code{v} is the result of an asynchronous call; it is an
 implicit future.
% The dynamic type of \code{v} is a future that is a dynamically created subtype of 
%\code{V}. 
 When the future value is needed to continue execution, such as in \code{v.foobar()}, 
 a wait-by necessity automatically occurs if the future is not resolved. In ProActive,  
 proxies are used to handle transparently active objects and futures.
% In ProActive, when an active object is created, it is registered in the
% RMI registry delivered with Java. A local reference to this active object is also created: 
% a proxy that delegates invocations to the active object.

 The principle of the multi-active object programming model is to execute multiple
 requests of an active object in parallel, while controlling the concurrency. 
 In practice, the 
 programmer can declare which requests (i.e. which methods of the active object) can be 
 safely executed in parallel. The internal scheduler of an active objects will allocate 
 as many threads as necessary to run those methods in parallel.
  In 
 ProActive, 
  can be used through a metalanguage, based on Java annotations.  Such requests are 
  called \emph{compatible} requests. The 
 following is an
 example of multiactive object annotations in ProActive: 
 \lstset{morekeywords={@DefineGroups,@Compatible,@DefineRules,@Group,@MemberOf} }
\begin{lstlisting}
@Group(name="group1", selfCompatible=true)
@Group(name="group2", selfCompatible=false)
@Compatible({"group1", "group2"})
public class MyClass {
  ...
  @MemberOf("group1")   
  public ... method1(...) { ... }
  
  @MemberOf("group2")   
  public ... method2(...) { ... }
}
\end{lstlisting}
In this example, two groups of requests are defined, each of them holding one method. 
The two groups are declared to be compatible (so as their method, by extension). The 
\code{selfCompatible} parameter defines whether two different requests of the same group 
are allowed to run in parallel. At runtime, a ready request is automatically executed if 
it is compatible with requests that are already executing and with older requests in the 
queue (to avoid starvation). 

Without annotations, a multi-active object is a mono-threaded active object, 
without 
any local parallelism nor race condition. Its programming is extremely simple. If some 
parallelism is desired, compatibility should be declared between requests 
that can be safely interleaved and for which execution order do not matter.
The programmer can also use dynamic informations such as request parameters or object's 
state to decide which requests are compatible.
If necessary, the programmer can even use traditional low-level Java synchronisation 
primitives to make more requests compatible but this goes a little beyond the traditional 
active-object model.

%Programming with multiactive objects follows those principles:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Without annotations, a mult-iactive object is a mono-threaded active object, 
%without 
%	any local parallelism nor race condition.
%\item If some  Compatible 
%	requests should access disjoint memory locations to avoid race conditions. Possibly, 
%	the expert programmer can also protect the access to some of the variables using a

%\end{itemize}
Other high-level specifications are available in multiactive
objects~\cite{henrio:hal-00916293}, such as request priority. To avoid thread explosion,
it is also possible to set a limit on the number of threads running in parallel.  The
limit can be applied in two ways: a hard limit restrains the overall number of threads
whereas a soft limit only counts threads that are not in wait-by-necessity. 
Additionally, threads can be limited per group.

As a conclusion, ASP and ProActive are based on the multiactive object programming
model.
This model is well adapted to non-expert because it provides high-level features for distribution 
and safe concurrency.

\NOTE{Below I write one paragraph on  each aspect we want to compare the language on. We 
will see later if these paragraphs stay here or are collected in another specific section}

\paragraph{Degree of synchronisation}
In ASP the only blocking synchronisation is the wait-by-necessity on a future, but the 
only way to have another thread running is to perform an invocation on an active object. 
Requests run until completion. Consequently, there is a lot of potential deadlocks in 
case of reentrant calls especially if no compatibility annotation is specified. On the 
contrary, synchronisation only occur when the future value is indeed needed and in 
particular future references can safely be transmitted between activities without 
requiring any additional synchronisation.

\paragraph{Degree of transparency}
In ASP the programmer is not explicitly exposed to the notion of future or active object 
except at active object creation. The syntax is the same as the syntax for sequential 
programming, there is no specific construct for waiting a future value or performing an 
asynchronous call. Very often a sequential code can be reused unchanged in a distributed 
setting.

\paragraph{Data sharing between threads and active objects}
ASP follows a strict policy of absence of sharing between active objects.Objects that are 
not active objects and are passed between activities (as request parameters or request 
results) are passed by copy. Of course this also applies to objects referenced by passed 
objects and a deep-copy mechanism is used ensuring that, when objects are transmitted 
between activities, they are copied as well as all their dependency on the destination 
side. This mechanism, which is the one used by RMI, slows down request invocation because 
of the time spent to transmit data, but accelerates request treatment because there is no 
need to contact another activity to get the value of the request parameters.

There is no coherency ensured between the different copies of a passive object, thus if 
the user wants to ensure that an object has a unique coherent state he should not 
transmit it by copy, and for example transmit an active-object reference instead.

\paragraph{Formal support and semantics}

Several papers formalise the semantics of ASP. The first of them formalised the 
mono-threaded part of the language and proved some determinacy 
properties~\cite{CHS:POPL04}. In particular, this paper proved that the order of future 
updates has no influence on the execution and that the only source of non-determinacy in 
mono-threaded ASP is when two activities can send a request to the same destination.
A functional fragment of the calculus has also been 
formalised in Isabelle/HOL~\cite{HKL:SCP11}. A specific semantics has been exhibited tin 
order to evaluate a functional ASP program without risk of having a deadlock; the absence 
of deadlock has been proved in Isabelle/HOL.
The full semantics of imperative ASP with multi-threaded activities is published 
in~\cite{HHI2013:mao}.

As shown in~\cite{BHR2014:gcm}, ProActive active objects, and active objects in general,
provide a convenient programming model for component based composition of distributed
applications. The ProActive library implements the GCM distributed component model. In
this context, the Vercors
platform\footnote{\url{https://team.inria.fr/scale/software/vercors/}} provides
verification capacities for ProActive components; Vercors consists of an Eclipse plugin
for designing component systems; from this point the Vercors platform can on one hand
verify the correct behaviour of the application using the CADP model-checker, and on the
other hand generate an executable ProActive/GCM corresponding to the designed system.

\TODO{do we want to put the language semantics here ?}

\paragraph{Implementation: programming and execution support}
ProActive is the Java library implementing ASP semantics. 
In ProActive, in order to transparently handle active objects and futures, a proxy is created for each of them. Proxies encapsulate all needed code to perform asynchronous, remote method invocations and wait-by-necessity behavior. Whenever an active object or a future is given as parameter of a call to an active object,  it is in fact their proxy that is copied. This way, all copies of a proxy of an active object/future points to this same active object/future. 
Another particular aspect of ProActive deals with
the deployment of ASP active objects on distributed infrastructures. The design choices of the programming language typically target a high performance of distributed ProActive applications. 
In order to settle active objects on distributed infrastructures, ProActive features a deployment specification mechanism. The goal of this mechanism is to make the physical deployment independent from the the deployment logic. This is possible by having a binding from virtual node names, used in the source code, to machine addresses or names. In practice, this binding is implemented in XML configuration files. Also, since the binding is made at \emph{deployment time}, changing infrastructure for a given ProActive application is localized in one or a few files and does not require application recompilation. 
Several machines can be aggregated under a single virtual node name in the deployment logic, for example to provide the virtual node with some properties or non functional deployment options (such as fault tolerance or logging). The deployment support of ProActive
